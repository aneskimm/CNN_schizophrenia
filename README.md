UTD NSF REU SOFTWARE: convolutional neural networks: brain computer simulations for non-invasive psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia

Neural Networks have been a critical aspect of deep learning methods in the subject of computer science. It refers to a methodology, whether biological or artificial, that mimics the way that the human brain learns and recognizes information. We will aim to review the correlations of the human brain to computer systems that are replicated by the former, in order to discover potential applications back to its origin. The brain, similar to the computer, has errors and outputs that are not expected by most of the population concerning cognitive disorders such as depression, anxiety, OCD, and schizophrenia. Previous research has proven there are correlations with the lack of brain activity to those with cognitive disorders compared to those with the average performance. With the development of a Neural Network deep learning algorithm, we could discover portions of the brain to electrically stimulate areas that are not as reactive during certain tasks. This may be able to offer potential solutions using machine learning applications to provide non-invasive psychiatric treatment, providing safer treatment avoiding potential injury or unwanted side effects.
